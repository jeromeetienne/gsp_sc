# TODO

- can i do the network renderer with camera ?
  - currently the camera is not properly serialized at all, it save the type only
  - locally it would change the camera...
  - and send the new camera position to the server ?
  - the server will render with the new camera position
  - aka the controller run on client and may change the camera
- support collection for all visuals
  - may create alias for the single case, which forwards to the collection case
  - pixels is already done
  - images and meshes to do
- how to do the global transform chain with global
- handle multiple matplotlib renderers at the same time ?
  - how to handle multiple canvas ?
  - how to handle multiple viewport
- get new animator function
  - current one got poor callback
  - it didnt update camera
- bring the scene graph here
  - canvas contains a scene root `Visual` visual is the new object3D
  - visual contains children visuals
  - cameras are also visuals
  - lights are also visuals

=========

- DONE change the renderer to support multiple viewports
  - DONE for MatplotlibRendererDelta
  - TODO for MatplotlibRenderer
- support `Images`
  - with multiple textures
- make a type for ndarray like nptyping
  - thus you can specify the shape of the array
- make all visual accept TransformChain
  - DONE for pixels on matplotlib+json renderer
  - generalize it to all parameters and all visuals
- BUG in rendering the multi viewport, i have a single camera
- add sanity check on the np.ndarray shapes type hinting

- DONE take end of video save from scene-graph
  - exit the script on end of video recording
- DONE fix the multiple viewports
  - one camera per viewport
  - how to handle camera in the scene ?
- FIXED multi viewport in json is broken
  - fixed ? write a test `multi_viewport_network.py`
- DONE move transform_chain to ./examples/common
- DONE the image is blank when interactive mode is on
  - because plt.savefig is not called ?
  - need to call it in the interactive loop ?
- DONE keep the rendering events - useful for some tricks
  - can i emulate the stuff from nicolas
- DONE the server rendered image still got some borders
  - while when rendering locally it is ok...
- DONE split matplotlib renderer in multiple files
  - one per visual type
- DONE support msgpack in serialisation
- DONE Add mesh visual with hidden faces
- DONE issue with serialisation: currently camera is not serialised
  - may require to have my own Camera class ...
  - not required, i can serialize the parameters (including the matrices)
- FIXED MatplotlibRendererDelta fails on multi viewport
- DONE keep only MatplotlibRendererDelta
  - remove MatplotlibRenderer
- DONE serialisation doesnt conserve uuid, fix this
- DONE Add type checking with pyright in Makefile
- DONE check all examples
- DONE make image work in 3d in MatplotlibRendererDelta
- DONE implement 3d
  - <https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-3d/> <- YES
  - <https://github.com/rougier/tiny-renderer/blob/master/bunny.py>
- DONE implement network client/server over http
  - `./network/client.py` send a scene.json
  - `./network/server.py` receive a scene.json and render it and send back a png
- DONE multiple viewports
- DONE from/to file
