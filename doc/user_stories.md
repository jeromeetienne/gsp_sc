# User Stories for GSP


# 1. As a data scientist, I want to visualize large datasets stored on a remote server without downloading them to my local machine, so that I can comply with data privacy regulations.

- it needs to be easy to use and efficient
- it needs to support large datasets
- it needs to be able to create dummy data locally for testing

# 2. As a software developer, I want to integrate GSP into my existing data analysis pipeline, so that I can easily visualize the results of my computations.

- it needs to have a simple and well-documented API
- it needs to support common data formats
  - produce images in svg or pdf format to include in my papers

# 3. As a researcher, I want to create interactive visualizations of my data that can be shared with collaborators, so that we can explore the data together.
