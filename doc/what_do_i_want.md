# What do I want ?
- no endless arguments on obvious matter
  - we should not discuss if global is good
  - we should not discuss if code duplication is bad
  - we should not discuss if comments are good
  - we should not discuss if tests are good
  - we should not discuss if naming things is important
  - we should not discuss if single letters variable are bad
  - we should not commit code without executing it

---

- limit the "lets reinvent the wheel" discussions"
- limit the "lets redo the mistakes we already did"

# How to design an API
- we write a .pyi stub file first
- it includes extensive docstrings
- it includes strong typing hints
- we write examples of readusage on it
  - .pyi and examples must pass pyright
- when we are happy enough with how the examples look, we start implementing it

# 
- i want clear definiton of task
- i want to be allowed to code
