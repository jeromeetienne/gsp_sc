- no doc associated to the fields
  - similar to __doc__ for classes
- no string typing in the generated python code
  - https://pypi.org/project/types-protobuf/ suppose to fix the problem
  - cant make it work for now 
  - WORK with --pyi_out option of protoc
- LOTS of globals in the generated python code
  - hard to track where things come from
- ALL the id fields are uint32
  - should be uint64 to avoid collisions in a distributed system
- requirement of a compiler tool (protoc)
  - need to integrate that in the build system
  - need to distribute the protoc binary with the project
